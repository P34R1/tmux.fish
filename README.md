[!NOTE]

This is a fork of [budimanjojo's tmux.fish](https://github.com/budimanjojo/tmux.fish) which is a much better project for beginners. This is just a horrible simplification of the code to fit my exact needs.

This is close to equivelent to:
- fish_tmux_autostart=true
- fish_tmux_autostart_once=false
- fish_tmux_autoquit=true
- fish_tmux_default_session_name=default
- fish_tmux_unicode=true
- fish_tmux_no_alias=true
